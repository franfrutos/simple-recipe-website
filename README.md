# simple-recipe-website

This is a repo to put together all my git, github and HTML progress.

I'm following the [odin project website](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) for this HTML project. [Here](https://franfrutos.github.io/simple-recipe-website/) you have a link to the website.

I think that with this project I have learn a bunch of things. But, for summarise, the most importants are:

1. How anchors can guide you to elements **inside** a html document.
2. Don't forget to use ../ when pointing to something in a "sibling document" (I have lose like 10 minutes atemping to fix the images). 
3. Theres is special symbols or characters wich needs to use html or css code to be show.
