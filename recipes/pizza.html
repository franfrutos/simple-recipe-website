    <ul><h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>3 <span>&#189;</span> cups all-purpose flour, or as needed </li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's Pizza Crust Yeast </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar </li>
        <li>1 <span>&#189;</span> teaspoons salt </li>
        <li>1 <span>&#190;</span> cups very warm water (120 degrees to 130 degrees F) </li>
        <li> <span>&#190;</span> cup oil  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Additional flour for rolling  </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Additional oil for grilling </li>
        <li><span>&#189;</span> cup Pizza sauce  </li> 
        <li>Other toppings as desired   </li>
        <li>1 ounce Shredded mozzarella cheese </li>

    </ul>
    <ol><h3>Steps:</h3>
        <li> Start charcoal fire or preheat gas grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li> Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch circles; they do not need to be perfect.</li>
        <li> Brush both sides of crust with additional oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until bottom is lightly browned and top looks set. Using long handled tongs, remove crust from grill, grilled side up, to a platter or baking sheet.</li>
        <li> Lightly add sauce and top the grilled side of each pizza crust. Excess sauce or toppings makes the pizza hard to handle. Repeat with remaining pizzas.</li>
        <li> Carefully slide each pizza onto the grill. Cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom of crust is browned and cheese is melted. Remove from grill and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
