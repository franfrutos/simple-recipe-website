    <h1>My favorite recipes website</h1>
    <p>Hey! This website is dedicated to explain some of my favourite recipies in the world (so far).</p>
    <p>I will select this recipies from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/" target="_blank">allrecipies</a>, which seems to be <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/food-and-drink/cooking-and-recipes/" target="_blank">one of the most visited pages</a> for looking for recipies.</p>
    <p>As you may have noticed, this recipes are not made by chefs, but by normal people. I think is interesting becouse there is a lot of variability and cook time is slow, which is perfect for busy people!</p>
